# Requirement
Design a microservice which does number block management from a telco perspective.
1. need to track status of numbers
2. need to track history of numbers
3. decouple service and number, anything to do with service delivered to the customer using that number is not needed
4. microservice must be able to scale horizontally
5. microservice must supply API to frontend order portal for number selection

# CDN 
Content Distribution Network is used to speed up clients' access and provides protection from large surges in traffic to mitigate the load pressure. 

# FireWall
Ensure network security.

# LVS
Load balancing improves the distribution of workloads (request from clients) across multiple clusters.

# Nginx
Following the URL address rules, nginx distributes multiple request from clients to the corresponding server.

# Redis
Based pubsub pattern (publish-subscribe pattern) and types of list data, implement message queue over redis to maximize the throughput.  

# Solr
Catching the history information by Solr maximizes the efficiency of query to status/histories. Index is updated hourly.

# Code Structure
* **Common Modules**:</br>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;common: Public class, such as enumerate, constant, general class for service independent unit, etc. </br>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;config: Custom Configuration</br></br>
* **Presentation Layer**:</br>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;controller: It is in charge of page access control and exposing Rest API interface.</br>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;dao: It is short for data access object. MyBatis is chosen as ORM. </br></br>
* **Business Logic Layer**:</br>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;service: Service interface includes business logic. </br>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;entity: Model Class</br>

# About Optimizaion
The mini project is implemented by some basic technologies.It can be better in performance.</br>
Such as the things in Architecture image.e.g:solr, redis...
